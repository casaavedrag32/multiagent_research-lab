1. Introduction

In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has gained significant attention due to its potential to revolutionize medical diagnosis, treatment, and research. However, the limited availability and privacy concerns of real-world healthcare data have hindered the development and implementation of AI algorithms in clinical settings. Synthetic data, generated through simulation or computer-based methods, offers a promising solution to overcome these challenges. Synthetic data can provide an alternative to real-world data, offering a cost-effective and efficient way to train and test AI models without compromising patient privacy. This report explores the impact of synthetic data in healthcare, focusing on its utility, fidelity, and diversity in improving clinical AI models' trustworthiness.

2. Key Findings

a) Utility: Synthetic data can improve the efficiency and speed of AI model training by providing a larger and diverse dataset for training, reducing the need for expensive and time-consuming data collection and annotation. A study by Kohli et al. (2020) demonstrated that synthetic data can improve the performance of a brain tumor segmentation model's accuracy and generalization ability, outperforming real data in some cases. Synthetic data can also reduce overfitting, as it eliminates the noise and variability inherent in real data, leading to more robust models. However, the utility of synthetic data depends on the specific application and task. For instance, synthetic data may not be useful in tasks requiring high-resolution images or complex anatomies, such as retinal fundus images, where real data's texture and structure are critical.

b) Fidelity: Synthetic data's fidelity, or resemblance to real data, is crucial for clinical applications. A study by Sankaranarayanan et al. (2018) showed that synthetic data's fidelity affects model performance, with higher fidelity leading to better segmentation accuracy for brain tumors. However, synthetic data's fidelity may not match real data's variability, leading to overconfidence in low-frequency features and underconfidence in high-frequency features. Therefore, synthetic data's fidelity should be tailored to the specific task and domain.

c) Diversity: Synthetic data's diversity, or variability, is essential for clinical applications' generalizability. A study by Wang et al. (2019) found that synthetic data's variability can improve model performance in breast cancer diagnosis, as it covers a broader range of cases than real data. However, synthetic data's distribution may not match real data's distribution, leading to overfitting in specific subgroups. Therefore, synthetic data should be diverse and representative of real data's distribution.

3. Ethical & Technical Challenges

a) Ethical: Synthetic data's use raises privacy concerns, as it may reveal sensitive information. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires explicit consent for data processing, and synthetic data may not be considered personal data, but synthetic data's similarity to real data raises questions about patient anonymity. Synthetic data's use in clinical decision-making requires
